# Discord Nitro Code Checker
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed first!
Step 1: Put your codes and HTTP/Socks5 proxies in the folder (You can remove codes.txt and proxies.txt)
Step 2: Open index.js in a text editor. (You can skip step 2, step 3 and step 4 if you want to generate it automatically)
Step 3: Change codes.txt and proxies.txt to what your file names are for those. (You can also set options!)
Step 4: Save the file
Step 5: Open Command Prompt (Windows: windows key + r, then type 'cmd' without quotes. Mac: command + space then type 'Terminal' without quotes.)
Step 6: Navigate to the folder in Command Prompt (Search it up on the internet, I cant explain)
Step 6: Type 'npm install'
Step 7: Type 'node index.js'
Step 8: It will now generate and check the codes!
